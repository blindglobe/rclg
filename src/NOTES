rclg-types:sexptype
  "Gets the sexptype of an robj.  WARNING: ASSUMES THAT THE TYPE
IS STORED IN THE LOW ORDER 5 BITS OF THE SXPINFO-STRUCT, AND THAT
IT CAN BE EXTRACTED VIA A 'mod 32' OPERATION!  MAY NOT BE PORTABLE."

(defvar *r-NA-internal* -2147483648) ;;  PLATFORM SPECIFIC HACK!!!

rclg-convert:sequence-to-robj is sbcl-specific!  Should think about
removing rclg-helpers for more portability, if it's fast enough.

Consolidate with-gensyms somewhere?

We only get r-names and r-dims back at the "toplevel" call to r.
Should rnb protect?  Don't think we're using poss-sexp for anything...
