rclg-types:sexptype
  "Gets the sexptype of an robj.  WARNING: ASSUMES THAT THE TYPE
IS STORED IN THE LOW ORDER 5 BITS OF THE SXPINFO-STRUCT, AND THAT
IT CAN BE EXTRACTED VIA A 'mod 32' OPERATION!  MAY NOT BE PORTABLE."

* SBCL-specific hacks

rclg-convert:sequence-to-robj is sbcl-specific!  Should think about
removing rclg-helpers for more portability, if it's fast enough.

Consolidate with-gensyms somewhere?

We only get r-names and r-dims back at the "toplevel" call to r.
Should rnb protect?  Don't think we're using poss-sexp for anything...

with-r-traps is SBCL specific.  
Multiprocessing stuff (with mutex) is SBCL specific.

In R, memory.c contains allocVector.  Looks like it *should* be doable
to directly pass vectors around (non-portably, of course).
