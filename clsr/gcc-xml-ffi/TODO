1. I should really figure out how to automatically run the sh/configure/make magic to build the .xml file

1. Deal with elipsis... This is tough. There's really nothing that can
   be done here except maybe some function that generates a new alien
   function every time it is executed, but this would be horribly
   inefficient. It's up to the programmer to hand-code the used varags
   forms and use those.

2. DONE - Deal with function type. I think this is handled properly now.

3. Deal with file. Perhaps we should have some way of mapping from
   files to packages.

C++ Stuff

4. Deal with constructors and destructors!
5. Deal with ReferenceType


Uh oh... What to do about function pointers????

6. Add class and support for <Method> tag
7. Investigate C++ issues

8. Need to chase required types for arrays, methinks.

9. 2005-08-27 - Need to chase the required types for function pointers!

10. 2005-09-24 - Some problems with mutually recursive struct
    definitions. This is turning into a huge nightmare. OK, it seems
    to be much better now. At least I can compile the quicktime XML
    bits that were giving me fits before.

11. Should consider removing the decl arguments to all of the
    functions in gcc-xml-sb-alien.cl and instead have a special
    variable that contains the decls. This would clean the code up a
    bit.
