CLSR is Cyrus Harmon's R within CommonLisp embedding.  

* Introduction

This work is an attempt by AJ Rossini <blindglobe@gmail.com> to
document his design approach.  Much of what we are doing is thinking
about what a general interface might be.

* Framework

3 packages are needed:

1. clsr
2. ch-utils
3. gccxml-ffi

along with a patch to R, to remove signal handling.

** clsr
