CLSR (a Common Lisp interface to the S language in R) (or something
like that).

This package consists of an interface from common lisp to the R
language using the C APIs to the R language. One day I hope to allow
for R code to directly execute lisp code, but this functionality is
not there yet.

Currently this requires the SBCL (Steel Bank Common Lisp)
implementation of the common lisp language. In theory, this could be
made to work with one of the more generic FFI packages such as UFFI or
CFFI, but currently it is wed to the sbcl sb-alien interface. Porting
this to CMUCL should be trivial; porting this to other lisps such as
Allegro, Lispworks, OpenMCL, clisp, ecl, etc... would be a bit more
work as each of their FFI interfaces are a bit different, and more
different from each other than CMUCL's and SBCL's are (as SBCL is a
relatively recent fork of CMUCL).


DEPENDENCIES

ch-util
gcc-xml-ffi
clem (for tests)
xmls
uffi


NOTES

The low-level interface to the R library is done via gcc-xml-ffi and
additional funcations are definied on top of these primitives to
provide higher-level support for executing R queries and returning
values to lisp.

Thanks to Duncan Temple-Lang for assuring me that this is not a
ridiculous thing to do and for technical advice. Thanks to Robert
Gentlemen, Seth Falcon, and the rest of the R and Bioconductor folks
for additional technical advice and inspiration.
